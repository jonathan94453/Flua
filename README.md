# PickHacks 2025 -- Flua: A Language Learning App

## Inspiration
We realized that learning a new language can often feel dull, so we set out to make it an engaging and enjoyable experience. This project is our way of transforming language learning into something fun and exciting!

## What it does
Flua is an open world game where you can interact with characters that speak your language of choice, and help you get experience with talking and having conversations in your desired language. 

## How we built it
We used ExpressJS for the backend, creating endpoints that leveraged Google's Gemini API, to generate dynamic AI responses for the characters. 
On the frontend we used PhaserJS for game logic, and implemented complex math equations and scripts to have procedural generation of terrain. 
We used gimp for graphics design. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble setting up a full stack development server. We also had trouble separating logic out into multiple files. Therefore creating a bottleneck when developers wanted to work on the same file. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a full stack web game, with limited time and resources that leverages AI to solve a real world problem. 
## What we learned
Full stack development, git collaboration, new frameworks, teamwork.

## What's next for Flua
We plan to deploy, and allow users anywhere to learn a language and have fun!
